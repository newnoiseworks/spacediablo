# Skills n Classes

#### Or, Powers and Heroes

### 4 Powers <--> Super Hero

So, games in the classic DnD > Diablo vein (POE) have classes you pick from the beggining, and skills are at times attached directly to the classes, or are separate things (gems in POE) and classes have various attributes to make them better / worse with given skills.

Warframe, however, has a 4 skill <--> Warframe relationship, which I like because it provides distinction per Warframe, and I'd like to elaborate on this somewhat.

What if each "class" was a "super hero" whom is discovered / built / made accessible to the player after they've found the 4 skills which would be something like gems. That way ti would be like unlocking / building new warframes (kind of) to discover new classes, as well as (mostly for the sake of lore, as well as another thing to accomplish) attaching skills to "super hero" classes so they can exist in game lore as individual identities.

This allows "classes" to behave similarly to POE, where everyone can technically use whatever skill found in gems, but allows for more opportuinity to create classes continuously through the game's existence and extend the lore thusly etc etc.

This is also why I want to avoid having armor which would force remodeling of each character - that would make it easier to have a limit of 3-5 characters be justified, and it would be more in the vein of creating a comic book universe if we were making it easy to scale up character wise.

In terms of translating this to comic nerds, it's like saying "hey what if instead of being really acrobatic, Nightcrawler had Wolverine's adamantium claws, but still had his teleportation power?"
