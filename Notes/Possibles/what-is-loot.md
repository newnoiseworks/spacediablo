# Gimme The Loot

#### Loot.

So, loot is kind of a multi thorned problem given some of my other thoughts on approaching development etc of this game. Mainly, not having various armors to avoid visually updating models creates an issue of what items do constitute loot?

##### Possible Loot Stuff

- powers (gems? scripts? runtimes?)
- belts? lol
  - we don't really need to visually update a belt, plus it's kind of a super hero stereotype? could hold "scripts"
- weapons (see weapons.md in this folder)
