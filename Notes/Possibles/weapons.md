# Weapons

#### Thoughts.

## Powers vs weapons

Should weapons function in the same slots as powers? meaning, a power would be equivalent to a weapon? This would discourage weapons overall - which is fine, tbh, less things to create. Could powers be used in conjunction with weapons? it would be cool.


## Possible Weapon Types

- could have a few standard types, similar to fornite with guns where they're loosely named and not specific
  - guns
    - revolver
    - shotgun
    - automatic rifle
  - melee
    - fist stuff? like gloves or something that can be easily "attached" to models?
    - staffs? (staves?) 
      - could be hard to animate / find animations
        - swords are the backup here
    - daggers
  - other projectiles
    - a green lantern's ring woudl be so cool. especially if they were limited to like 6 or something, and only one person in the connected realm at a time could be the green lantern. Or something.
    - bow and arrow?
    - grenade launcher / rocket launcher?

## Possible Weapon Level / Variant Systems

Because it's only one revolver if there isn't several kinds.

Could go with Borderlands style white, green, blue, orange, purple(?) color coordinate leveling style, along with posion/fire/lightning/water boosts? (Elements are a whole other discussion and how they should work into this whole thing).
