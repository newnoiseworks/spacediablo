# Content Pipeline

#### A high level thought smear on how to make art from a business perspective

Why is this important? Money mostly. It's going to be hard to predict and budget around continuously creating content for this project as is the idea without knowing what it entails from a perspective of whom does what and when and gives what to whom etc etc.

So while this is all dehumanizing and despiriting to the truest, rawest, respect for the idea of creativity, I only got some much money to lose on this. At first I'll be relying on contractors to work on a part time project basis so I also need to articulate this as muhc as possible in case people can't talk to each other directly.

## How Content Gets Made

Steps may be optional, irrational, completely missing the point, or in the wrong order.

1. Initial Concepting
   Let's talk about it, and confirm it's worth it to move forward if it's not a requirement

1. Requirement Gathering
   Super businessy catch all for "stuff to give to an artist or narrative designer or whomever is wearing that hat"

1. Concepting
   Work with narrative people to define initial story / inspiration as needed
   Work with concept artists to define visual ideas for "it"

1. 3D Modeling + Texturing (????)

   Pass concept artist stuff to 3d modelers

1. Rigging + Animation (????)

   Pass models to rig + animators

1. Programming

   Program things into the game as expected and defined from the requirements we gathered earlier.
