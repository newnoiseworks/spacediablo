# Ideas for Acts

#### Acts will be the main partition point for the game, ala D2, POE, et. al.

Suggestions made below are in order. Keep in mind they kind of relate to larger goals re: scheduling, sort of (this is in the possible folder after all)

0. "Danger Room" - basically our prototype area
1. Golden / Silver age era Superman do goodery style, Norman Rockwell Suburbs + a Metropolish kind of positive vibe
2. Bronze age - things are darker, we're dealing with criminals in dark alleys and stuff, but not full on...
3. Dark age - have something plot wise signify this (someone dies etc)
4. Modern and on and on
