# A Potential Schedule

#### You see the word potential there? Ok. Just saying. Also, check the date. This is mostly for scheduling goals for the end of 2018.

### Loose list of items I can work on over the next 4-6 weeks to schedule below

- Look into playmode testing a bit more, think about integrating with existing movement code, or waiting for ECS, really depends on the approach to playmode testing
- Basic animation integration from mixamo for characters
- Combat systems
  - initial spells / powers
  - attribute hierarchy


## The schedule 

Note, this is tighter / more directed for the end of 2018 as a side effect of when it was first written / mused about.

* 8.18
  - Confirming SpatialOS usage for prototyping stage
  - Project planning / timing stuff for the end of Q3 / start of Q4
  - Game / Keyboard / Mouse Controller stuff (.5-1 wks, 1-2 wks w/ stretch)
    - Finalizing existing code approaches
    - STRETCH: Incorporate WASD approach (try some ARPGs to see how they handle it wrt strafing etc)
* 9.18
  - SpatialOS integration (3-5 wks, 4-6 wks w/ stretch)
    - STRETCH: Potentially offline / online (this might take the entire time, involves upfront research)
    - Character / enemy / dungeon creation core stuff
    - Auth from twitch or w/e (could just gate w/ email)
* 10.18
  - Wrapping up SpatialOS Items
  - Unity ECS approach research / integration (??? wks - dependent on work situation)
    - I could rewrite things to support this earlier than not
    - SpatialOS will be releasing a new tutorial like Pirates w/ ECS integrated, unfortunately in October
      - I could hold everything Spatial and / or ECS related off until this and use it as a rubric
      - OR I could integrate / change things when they release



* 12.19 - Closed / open beta prototype with one complete Act
  - basically trying to make something with a bit of art
  - just mixamo / asset store stuff could be fine but a greater goal would be to have assembled contract help for assets
