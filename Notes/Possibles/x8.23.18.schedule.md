# A Potential Schedule

#### You see the word potential there? Ok. Just saying. Also, check the date. This is mostly for scheduling goals for the end of 2018.


### Manifest - 2019 Artless Prototype

#### Main Deliverable
A multiplayer prototype of the game at a high level with "enough" content to play through initial skill and item building for 5-10 player levels, without any custom art (asset store BS).

#### Deliverable assets (CAPS for production concerns)
- Codebase
  - Controller input
  - Multiplayer
  - ECS integration
  - Animation controls
  - Testing
- Game (design + implementation)
  - Enemies
    - Just TWO enemy types (maybe a boss)
  - Class system
    - post design - ONLY 2 examples
  - Skill tree system
    - NO DETAIL, just structure after lvl 10
  - Powers system
    - ONLY 4 SKILLS
  - Loot
    - Once designed, what is loot (see other notes), LIMIT IT
    - Possibly delay this for post prototype. No loot, just yet.
  - Damage systems
    - extremely lightweight.
  - Experience systems
    - LIMIT TO 10 lvls
    - extremely lightweight.

#### Contractable assets
- Assets for full prototype (* denotes contractor needed)
  - * concept art
  - * 3d models & textures
  - * animations
  - * environment assets
    - (could honestly probably get by on unity asset store stuff here)


### Some random goals to reorganize
- Look into playmode testing a bit more, think about integrating with existing movement code, or waiting for ECS, really depends on the approach to playmode testing
- Basic animation integration from mixamo for characters
- Combat systems
  - initial spells / powers
  - attribute hierarchy


## The schedule 

Note, this is tighter / more directed for the end of 2018 as a side effect of when it was first written / mused about.

* 8.18
  - Confirming SpatialOS usage for prototyping stage
  - Project planning / timing stuff for the end of Q3 / start of Q4
  - Game / Keyboard / Mouse Controller stuff (.5-1 wks, 1-2 wks w/ stretch)
    - Finalizing existing code approaches
    - STRETCH: Incorporate WASD approach (try some ARPGs to see how they handle it wrt strafing etc)

* 9.18
  - SpatialOS integration (3-5 wks, 4-6 wks w/ stretch)
    - STRETCH: Potentially offline / online (this might take the entire time, involves upfront research)
    - Character / enemy / dungeon creation core stuff
    - Auth from twitch or w/e (could just gate w/ email)

* 10.18
  - Wrapping up SpatialOS Items
  - Unity ECS approach research / integration (??? wks - dependent on work situation)
    - I could rewrite things to support this earlier than not
    - SpatialOS will be releasing a new tutorial like Pirates w/ ECS integrated, unfortunately in October
      - I could hold everything Spatial and / or ECS related off until this and use it as a rubric
      - OR I could integrate / change things when they release

* 11.18
  - ECS, making it testable online w/ people

* 12.18
* 1.19
  - animation combat code base (mixamo)

* 2.19
* 3.19
  - powers!; the animations, tieing in assets, etc etc

* 4.19
  - long term backend storage for player data
  - experience systems 
  - damage processing

* 5.19
* 6.19
  - super hero classes (reusing the same model) w/ skill trees 

* 7.19
  - enemies (basic, one more variant, I guess), tieing things together

* 8.19
* 9.19
  - Closed / open beta prototype with one "complete" "Act"
    - basically trying to make something with a bit of art / #content
    - just mixamo / asset store stuff could be fine but a greater goal would be to have assembled contract help for assets
    - not really missions discretely but you know

* 10.19
* 11.19
* 12.19 
* 2020+
  - Marketing for money for character, enemy, npc, and background art
  - Applying art
  - #content
