#### Things to figure out later, or sooner, at different priorities, and such.


## Unanswered
- generally, how should I use / take things written in these note files? in terms of priority, is everything assumed as must have, unless otherwise denoted?
  - it may be nice to treat everything here as a maybe unless it's in some other software e.g. Hack n Plan
- how to handle time planning over a long term? Hack n Plan works with milestones but it would be nicer to have a looser area / tool to play with things and maybe see them as a Gantt chart
