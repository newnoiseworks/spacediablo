#### Things to figure out later, or sooner, at different priorities, and such.


## Unanswered
- generally, how should I use / take things written in these note files? in terms of priority, is everything assumed as must have, unless otherwise denoted?
  - it may be nice to treat everything here as a maybe unless it's in some other software e.g. Hack n Plan
- how to handle time planning over a long term? Hack n Plan works with milestones but it would be nicer to have a looser area / tool to play with things and maybe see them as a Gantt chart
- the loot problem
  - if we're not having armor systems / much visual differentiation on the character model to represent loot... what is the loot's worth if it's not visual? Can we make some visual things without attaching them to the models?
  - gotta have that loot though
